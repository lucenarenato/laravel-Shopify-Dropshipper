            <h4 class="title"> You Have a New Order! </h4>

            <p>Congrats, you just received an order for a Product added with Amazone DropShipper!. As indicated in our FAQ section and ORDERS page the user is responsible for placing the order in Amazon/Walmart.</p>

            <h4>IMPORTANT NOTES FOR YOU</h4>
            <p>As a reminder, our app is a tool that helps you importing products details from Amazon (US, Canada, UK, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil and India) and Walmart (US)  to your Shopify Store. Whenever your store receives an order/purchase from a customer for a product that you imported with our app (and if you decided to dropship it through Amazon or Walmart) we just help you making easier the process but we don’t do the purchase or ship the product to your client in any case, we are not involved in that process. In this case, the store owner (you) have to place the order in Amazon or Walmart for the product your client just purchased. </p>

            <p>In addition a “View Orders” screen is available to help you with orders details. However, be mindful that Amazon doesn’t like users dropshiping their products although many people around the world do it. For more details read <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201808410?language=en-US&ref=mpbc_201808430_cont_201808410" target="_blank"> Amazon Policy On DropShipping</a>.</p>

            <p>While placing the order in Amazon or Walmart the shipping address has to be your client's address. For Amazon select gift option! As this way there will be no price sent to the client in the box. For Amazon Prime products they come in Amazon boxes but you can as well request the products with no receipt through the 'gift' option.</p>

            <p>When product is a 'non-Prime' product there is no Amazon info at all in product that client receives but the 'gift' option may not be available for the 'non-prime' product so price could be included if seller sends it.</p>
